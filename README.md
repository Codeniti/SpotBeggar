SpotMe
==========

Spot Me is a multipurpose android application/platform which provides the capability to report any issue near by and view any issue reported close to the current geo location. 

In this specific example we have used this platform to report homeless/beggars for end users and any person belonging to an NGO can view these beggars or homeless people in the proximity. 

Report a New Beggar : 

Take an image of the concerned person , the geo location is captured automatically and indicate if the person is genuine or a nuisance. 

This is information is captured at a central data store. 

View/Modify status of existing concerned person : 

Depending on the current geo location, the beggars in the current location can be viewed. There is an option to view the current statistics as to how many people are genuine or how many people are a nuisance.

Also we can indicate update the statistics indicating if the concerned person is a nuisance or a genuine person. 

Display beggars in the vicinity:



Again depending on the current geo location all the concerned beggars along with their statistics can be viewed in a grid fashion.
